# Welcome to the Echoes of Azeroth Discord Bot

I've created a Discord bot that is integrated into the server and website itself.  
Feel free to look over my project and ask any questions!

---

## Flask Web Service

The bot is hosted using a Flask web service (`_webServer.py`).  
It spins up a web service that uses `keep_alive` to keep the thread active.  
**Hosting Platform:** [Render](https://render.com)  
**Monitoring:** [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) is used to pin the server and ensure uptime.
