# Welcome to the Drenor Projects Discord Bot
I've created a discord bot that is integrated into the server and website itself
feel free to look over my project and ask any questions

# Flask Web Service
**The bot is hosted using a flask _webServer.py
it spins up a web service that uses the keep_alive to keep the thread alive**
**Using `Render` as its primary hosting platform and `uptimerobot` to pin the server**
